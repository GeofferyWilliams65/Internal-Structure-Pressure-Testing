# Ultimate Goal
#To test how different infills and internal structure affect pressure distribution across an object to try and make structurally stable 3D prints

# Repo
#I don't know what you want on the repo part (what you are asking)

# Current State
#Right now I am working on my own internal structures and test prints and plan to compare them to already made infills by 3D printing software
