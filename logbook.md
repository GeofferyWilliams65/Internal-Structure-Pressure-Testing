- Used TinkerCad to make a small 50cm by 50cm by 50 cm cube with a custom infill
- Edited the print down to 25cm using Cura
- Set it to print and came back after 8 hours
- Print inevitably failed due to it unsticking from the bed early on in the print

09/15/23
- Reset the print and got it to work
- Print ended up not having a thick enough shell so I went back into Cura and shrunk the internal structure to make it better fit as well as increasing the walls thickness
- Printed and came back after 8 hours to a successful cube

09/21/23
- Attempted to test Curas infills through making a 5cm by 25cm by 25cm hollow print
- After 3 attempts I realised that the infill required a solid shape
- Set the infill to 20% and printed it
- Came out well, and I later cut it in half to make sure the infill turned out correct

- Discussed with Seward about making a print to the size of the pressure tester that was ordered
- I misunderstood and made a 185 by 185 by 10 cm print to fit to the bed of the 3D printer
- Actually came out quite well after a day and let me know how large of prints I could make

10/09/23
- When I came into the MakerSpace to set a print up there was already one on the printer so I did some research and found a good source discussing structural integrity

10/13/23
- I came into the MakerSpace and the printer was dissasembled due to the extruder having issues
- Sasha's capstone is 3D printers so I am leaving it to him so as to not disturb his capstone

10/24/23
- I came into the Maker Space and attempted to help fix the 3D printer while also helping Grayson with the Pressure Sensing Array needed for later steps of testing

10/27/23
- I learned that the large printer still works and I might be able to use it for my capstone instead
- Spent some time doing research on it and it appears to just be a larger model of the current printer I am using; it is the CR-10 S5.

10/30/23
- Got Cura set up for the new printer and had the print resized properly
- Requested to start the print and got denied until the MakerSpace is cleaned

11/02/23
- Got told that the smaller printer is working again and to use the smaller one
- Reset my file for the CR 10
- Set the file print and had a small clog but it appeared to have worked itself out
